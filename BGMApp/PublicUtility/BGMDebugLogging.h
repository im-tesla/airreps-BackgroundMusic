//
//  Functions to globally enable/disable debug logging, i.e. more detailed logging to help diagnose
//  bugs. If debug logging is enabled, the DebugMsg macro from CADebugMacros.h (and possibly others)
//  will log messages. If not, it won't do anything.
//
//  If the preprocessor macro CoreAudio_UseSysLog is true, which is currently the case for all build
//  variants (see BGMApp/BGMApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj and
//  BGMDriver/BGMDriver.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj), those messages will be logged using syslog and
//  can be read using Console.app. Try searching for "background music", "bgm" or "coreaudiod".
//
//  Debug logging is enabled by default in debug builds, but in release builds you have to enable it
//  by option-clicking the status bar icon and then checking the Debug Logging menu item. Enabling
//  debug logging probably won't cause glitches, but we don't try to guarantee that and it's not
//  well tested.
