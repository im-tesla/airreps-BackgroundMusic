//
//  Tries to change BGMApp's output device when the user plugs in or unplugs an audio device, in the
//  same way macOS would change its default device if Background Music wasn't running.
//
//  For example, if you plug in some USB headphones, make them your default device and then unplug
//  them, macOS will change its default device to the previous default device. Then, if you plug
//  them back in, macOS will make them the default device again.
//
//  This class isn't always able to figure out what macOS would do, in which case it leaves BGMApp's
//  output device as it is.
