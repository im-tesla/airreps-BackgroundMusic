//  A menu item in the main menu that enables/disables debug logging. Only visible if you hold the
//  option down when you click the status bar icon to reveal the main menu.
//
//  TODO: It would be better to have this menu item in the Preferences menu (maybe in an Advanced
//        section) and always visible, but first we'd need to add something that tells the user how
//        to view the log messages. Or better yet, something that automatically opens them.
