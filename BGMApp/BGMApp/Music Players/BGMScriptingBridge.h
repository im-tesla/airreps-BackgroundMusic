//
//  A wrapper around Scripting Bridge's SBApplication that tries to avoid ever launching the application.
//
//  We use Scripting Bridge to communicate with music player apps, which we never want to launch
//  ourselves. But creating an SBApplication for an app, or sending messages/events to an existing one,
//  can launch the app.
//
//  As a workaround, this class has an SBApplication property, application (see below), which is nil
//  unless the music player app is running. That way messages sent while the app is closed are ignored.
//
