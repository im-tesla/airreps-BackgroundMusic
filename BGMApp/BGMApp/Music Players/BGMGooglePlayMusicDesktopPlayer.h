//
//  We have a lot more code for GPMDP than most music players largely because GPMDP has a WebSockets
//  API and because the user has to enter a code from GPMDP to allow BGMApp to control it.
//  Currently, the other music players all have AppleScript APIs, so for them the OS asks the user
//  for permission on our behalf automatically and handles the whole process for us.
//
//  This class implements the usual BGMMusicPlayer methods and handles the UI for authenticating
//  with GPMDP. BGMGooglePlayMusicDesktopPlayerConnection manages the connection to GPMDP and hides
//  the details of its API.
