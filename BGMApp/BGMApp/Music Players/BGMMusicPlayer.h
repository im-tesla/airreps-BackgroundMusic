//
//  The base classes and protocol for objects that represent a music player app.
//
//  To add support for a music player, create a class that implements the BGMMusicPlayer protocol
//  and add it to initWithAudioDevices in BGMMusicPlayers.mm.
//
//  You'll probably want to subclass BGMMusicPlayerBase and, if the music player supports
//  AppleScript, use BGMScriptingBridge. Your class might need to override the icon method if the
//  default implementation from BGMMusicPlayerBase doesn't work.
//
//  BGMSpotify will probably be the most useful example to follow, but they're all pretty
//  similar. The music player classes written so far all use Scripting Bridge to communicate with
//  the music player apps (see iTunes.h/Spotify.h) but any other way is fine too.
//
//  BGMDriver will use either the music player's bundle ID or PID to match it to the audio it
//  plays. (Though using PIDs hasn't been tested yet.)
//
//  If you're not sure what bundle ID the music player uses, install a debug build of BGMDriver
//  and play something in the music player. The easiest way is to do
//      build_and_install.sh -d
//  BGMDriver will log the bundle ID to system.log when it becomes aware of the music player.

@protocol BGMMusicPlayer <NSObject>

// Classes return an instance of themselves for each music player app they make available in
// BGMApp. So far that's always been a single instance, but that will probably change eventually.
// Most classes don't need to override the default implementation from BGMMusicPlayerBase.
//
// But, for example, a class for custom music players would probably return an instance for each
// custom player the user has created. (Also note that it could return an empty array.)
//
// TODO: I think the return type should actually be NSArray<instancetype>*, but that doesn't seem
//       to work. There's a Clang bug about this: https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=27323
//       (though it hasn't been confirmed yet).

// classes that provide a static (or at least bounded) number of music players, you can generate
// IDs with uuidgen (the command line tool) and include them in your class as constants. Otherwise,
// you'll probably want to store them in user defaults and load them in createInstancesWithDefaults.
