//  The menu item with the volume slider that controls system-related sounds. The slider is used to
//  set the volume of the instance of BGMDevice that system sounds are played on, i.e. the audio
//  device returned by BGMBackgroundMusicDevice::GetUISoundsBGMDeviceInstance.
//
//  System sounds are any sounds played using the audio device macOS is set to use as the device
//  "for system related sound from the alert sound to digital call progress". See
//  kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultSystemOutputDevice in AudioHardware.h. They can be played by any
//  app, though most apps use systemsoundserverd to play their system sounds, which means BGMDriver
//  can't tell which app is actually playing the sounds.
