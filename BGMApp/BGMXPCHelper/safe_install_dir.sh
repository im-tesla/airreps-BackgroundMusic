# safe_install_dir.sh
# BGMXPCHelper
#
# Copyright Â© 2016, 2017 Kyle Neideck
#
# Prints the path to a directory the BGMXPCHelper bundle can safely be installed to. Intended to be
# used as the INSTALL_DIR environment variable for xcodebuild commands. For example,
#     xcodebuild -project BGMApp/BGMApp.xcodeproj -target BGMXPCHelper -configuration Debug \
#     DSTROOT="/" INSTALL_DIR="$(BGMApp/BGMXPCHelper/safe_install_dir.sh)" install
#
# Instead of setting INSTALL_DIR, we could just move the installed bundle in post_install.sh, but
# then we would have to leave an unused copy of the bundle in the default installation directory. If
# we didn't, xcodebuild would fail in one of the post-processing steps it does after running
# post_install.sh.
#
# The default installation directory comes from the Daemonomicon
# <https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2083/_index.html>, which recommends
# installing daemons to /usr/local/libexec. But that isn't safe on many users' systems, because the
# Daemonomicon also recommends that
#
# "[...] daemons be owned by root, have an owning group of wheel, and use permissions 755
# (rwxr-xr-x) for executables and directories, and 644 (rw-r--r--) for files. In addition, every
# directory from your daemon up to the root directory must be owned by root and only writable by the
# owner (or owned by root and sticky). If you don't do this correctly, a non-admin user might be
# able to escalate their privileges by modifying your daemon (or shuffling it aside)."
#
# BGMXPCHelper runs as the unprivileged _BGMXPCHelper user, so I don't think it would be a security
# risk right now, but I could be wrong about that. We could also forget about this and give the
# _BGMXPCHelper privileges of some kind in a later version.
#
# Installing to /usr/local/libexec would be fine on a default OS X install, which doesn't have a
# /usr/local directory, but if the user has Homebrew installed it will have set them as the owner of
# /usr/local (even if it already existed and was owned by root). So if the owner or permissions for
# /usr/local/libexec aren't what we want we try /Library/Application Support instead.
#
# If given a directory as an argument, this script will print "1" if the directory meets the
# recommendation above, or "0" otherwise.
