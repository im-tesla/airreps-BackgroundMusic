//  BGMXPCHelper passes XPC messages between BGMDriver and BGMApp. So far it's only used for synchronization while starting IO.
//
//  BGMApp and BGMDriver usually communicate by changing device properties and listening for notifications about those changes, which the
//  HAL sends. We use XPC, or plan to use it, for the few cases that notifications don't suit. For example, shared memory regions can be
//  sent via XPC. So we might be able to share a ring buffer between BGMDriver and BGMApp and avoid the latency and CPU overhead of
//  sending the audio data through an input stream. XPC should also let us safely send messages from real-time functions.
//
//  Notifications would have probably worked fine for synchronizing BGMDriver and BGMApp while starting IO. But the Core Audio headers
//  don't specify which threads notifications are sent/received on, what (if anything) they can block on, or what can be blocked by their
//  handler callbacks. So using XPC instead makes it a bit easier to reason about the process and avoid potential deadlocks. (That said,
//  I ended up adding a huge amount of error handling and boilerplate code for XPC, so this way is probably more confusing overall.)
//
//  CFMessagePort would be much simpler than XPC to use, but as far as I could tell there's no way to create a remote CFMessagePort for
//  a Mach port without looking the Mach port up using the bootstrap service. And because BGMXPCHelper and BGMApp have to use different
//  bootstrap namespaces, BGMXPCHelper wouldn't be able to see services vended by BGMApp. So BGMXPCHelper would be able to receive
//  messages from BGMApp and reply to them, but not send them.
//
//  BGMXPCHelper has to run as a launchd daemon so the Mach service it vends will use the global bootstrap namespace. See Table 2 in
//  <https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2083/_index.html>. This is because the coreaudiod process, where BGMDriver runs,
//  uses the global bootstrap namespace, which means it can only see services in that namespace. In practical terms, this just means we
//  have to run BGMXPCHelper by creating a launchd.plist file for it in /Library/LaunchDaemons and loading it with a command like
//      launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.bearisdriving.BGM.XPCHelper.plist
